# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

What I Learned

Developing the Hangman Game enhanced my understanding in several key areas:

1.Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
   Creating classes, defining methods, and managing objects helped structure the game efficiently, applying principles of object-oriented programming.
   
2.User Input Handling and Validation:
  Validating and processing user input taught me to manage various scenarios, ensuring the game responded appropriately to different inputs.
  
3.Error Handling and Debugging:
  Troubleshooting bugs and errors improved my error handling and debugging skills, aiding in resolving issues efficiently.
  
4.Documentation and Project Management:
Creating clear documentation and managing project tasks improved my communication skills and project management abilities.
